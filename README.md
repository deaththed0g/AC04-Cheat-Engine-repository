# dead_d0g's AC04 Cheat Engine repository

Here you'll find the Cheat Engine (CE) tables I've created for **Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies**.

These tables contains scripts and a compilation of relevant memory addresses that are product of my own research and have helped me to understand how the game works as well giving me the opportunity to modify data, find new things in the process and opening the doors to potential game mods.

While these scripts were primarily created for helping with game research they can also be used for cheating. Stuff like giving the player infinite ammo, health, time, etc. can be also achieved with said scripts.
